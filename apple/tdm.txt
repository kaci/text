TDM allows Apple computers with OpenBoot firmware or newer firmware to boot into a state where the Mac system appears as an external disk enclo-
sure and the internal disks are available as SCSI target devices. Earlier TDM implementations used the FireWire bus but have since moved to Thunder-
bolt. You activate this mode by holding down the T key while powering on the Apple computer.
